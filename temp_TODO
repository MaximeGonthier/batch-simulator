Column E + F
Each line is an hour, so need to consider that for job that overlap multiple lines where the job is and how much of each line does it use and use this for carbon intensity
formula is for a job that last from 1.2 to 2.4 : you consider time slice on each hour slice
We can have full knowledge of the future carbon intensity but still execute job as early as possible, don't reorde them to arrange for carbon intensity
Or without full knowledge and the carbon intensity that we won't do for now

it's over a year for each file
modify carbon intensity
loop on the one year cycle

desktop and midway go to PJM
theta goes to MISO
and faster the last one

Only for CBA obviously


modify hashed figs and table 5 and 6



TODO: instead of using a single slice like I do now, use a portion of multiple slice!
