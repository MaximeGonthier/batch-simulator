abstract = {Clusters of workstations (COWs) and SMPs have become popular and cost effective means of solving scientific problems. Because such environments may be heterogenous and/or time shared, dynamic load balancing is central to achieving high performance. Our thesis is that new levels of sophistication are required in parallel algorithm design and in the interaction of the algorithms with the runtime system. To support this thesis, we illustrate a novel approach for application-level balancing of external CPU and memory load on parallel iterative methods that employ some form of local preconditioning on each node. There are two key ideas. First, because all nodes need not perform their portion of the preconditioning phase to the same accuracy, the code can achieve perfect loadbalance, dynamically adapting to external CPU load, if we stop the preconditioning phase on all processors after a fixed amount of time. Second, if the program detects memory thrashing on a node, it recedes its preconditioning phase from that node, hopefully speeding the completion of competing jobs hence the relinquishing of their resources. We have implemented our load balancing approach in a state-of-the-art, coarse grain parallel Jacobi-Davidson eigensolver. Experimental results show that the new method adapts its algorithm based on runtime system information, without compromising the overall convergence behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm in a COW environment under (a) variable CPU load and (b) variable memory availability caused by competing applications.},

abstract="Most commercial multicomputers use space-slicing schemes in which each scheduling decision has an unknown impact on the future: should a job be scheduled, risking that it will block other larger jobs later, or should the processors be left idle for now in anticipation of future arrivals? This dilemma is solved by using gang scheduling, because then the impact of each decision is limited to its time slice, and future arrivals can be accommodated in other time slices. This added flexibility is shown to improve overall system utilization and responsiveness. Empirical evidence from using gang scheduling on a Cray T3D installed at Lawrence Livermore National Lab corroborates these results, and shows conclusively that gang scheduling can be very effective with current technology.",

SLURM, initially developed for large Linux clusters at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), is a simple cluster manager that can scale to thousands of processors. SLURM is designed to be flexible and fault-tolerant and can be ported to other clusters of different size and architecture with minimal effort. We are certain that SLURM will benefit both users and system architects by providing them with a simple, robust, and highly scalable parallel job execution environment for their cluster system.",

abstract="As large scale computation systems are growing to exascale, Resources and Jobs Management Systems (RJMS) need to evolve to manage this scale modification. However, their study is problematic since they are critical production systems, where experimenting is extremely costly due to downtime and energy costs. Meanwhile, many scheduling algorithms emerging from theoretical studies have not been transferred to production tools for lack of realistic experimental validation. To tackle these problems we propose Batsim, an extendable, language-independent and scalable RJMS simulator. It allows researchers and engineers to test and compare any scheduling algorithm, using a simple event-based communication interface, which allows different levels of realism. In this paper we show that Batsim's behaviour matches the one of the real RJMS OAR. Our evaluation process was made with reproducibility in mind and all the experiment material is freely available.",
