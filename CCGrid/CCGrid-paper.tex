\title{Locality-aware batch scheduling on I/O intensive workloads}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}

%~ Abstract by Maxime:
%~ Schedulers proposed by resource manager like SLURM
%~ (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) or OAR are
%~ efficient enough for a classical use of a cluster. 
%~ Certain areas of research are highly data-dependent, and thus
%~ requires large input files to be loaded ahead of the computation.
%~ In these cases, users may submits tens to hundreds of jobs using the
%~ same multi-GB input file.
%~ The sum of these large communications, adds significant queue times for
%~ all subsequent jobs. A solution to reduce the effects from I/O reads would be to 
%~ force users to manually group together input files into a single job. 
%~ However, to offer more flexibility to the users and avoid creating jobs
%~ monopolizing a large number of nodes for a very long time, we would like to
%~ let users submit jobs the way they want and schedule efficiently those jobs
%~ on our nodes. 

%~ The workers have a way to store files (with a limit on the memory size).
%~ Thus, a way to minimize data transfers is to schedule jobs using identical files
%~ on the same set of nodes. In this work we address the problem of
%~ \textit{distributing jobs sharing large input files on a cluster.}
%~ We present three schedulers that \textit{take into consideration data locality
%~ to minimize data transfers and thus reduce the mean waiting time of a job}.

%~ These new approaches are evaluated using real cluster's history
%~ allowing us to replicate the behavior of real users.
%~ We compare our heuristics to the First-Come-First-Serve heuristic
%~ coupled with a conservative backfilling strategy, as well as a communication-aware strategy
%~ called Earliest-Finish-Time. We show that overall, our algorithms achieve
%~ a significant speed-up, mainly under job-intensive periods.

%~ In addition we study a few different typical usage of a cluster. 
%~ and show that our strategy can be tuned regarding different user
%~ behavior on different clusters.

  Clusters and supercomputers make use of workload schedulers such as

These schedulers
  usually aim at a good trade-off between increasing resource
  utilization and user satisfaction (decreasing job waiting
  time). However, these schedulers are typically unaware of jobs

  hundreds of jobs dedicated to the study of the same multi-GB input
  file may be successively submitted. Running each of these jobs
  first requires to load the input file, leading to a large data
  transfer overhead. Users could manually group some of these
  tasks into larger jobs to reduce data transfers, but this would result in less granular units that are
  more difficult to schedule by the resource manager, and would
  thus result in a larger delay as well. We study how to design a \textit{data-aware
    job scheduler} that is able to keep large input files on the 
  computing nodes, provided this does not impact the memory needs of
  other jobs, and can use previously loaded files to \textit{limit
    data transfers in order to reduce the waiting times of jobs}.

  We present three schedulers capable of distributing the load between

  We report simulations performed using real cluster usage traces. 
  Our approach is compared to currently used schedulers in batch systems.
  The results show that keeping data locally, in memory, between successive
  jobs and using data locality information to schedule jobs allows a
  reduction in job waiting time and a drastic decrease in the amount of data
  transfers.

\todo[inline]{LM: I changed memory into storage: is it correct ? Carl: I changed back, the point is that these large files are kept in memory with heavy random accesses. There are of course cases where local scratch is sufficient for random accesses, but this not the scenario we've been focusing on. Changed it back.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec.introduction}

\section{Related Work - Draft}\label{sec.related_work}

\paragraph{Scheduling jobs on large clusters}

To schedule jobs on batch systems, two systems are prominent: the Slurm Workload Manager~\cite{SLURM} and OAR~\cite{oar}.
Slurm is used on most HPC clusters. Its default strategy is to schedule jobs baed on priorities derived
from submission time, in other words a First-Come First-Serve strategy
(or FCFS)\footnote{{\scriptsize\url{https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html}}}.

On top of that, a backfilling algorithm is often used~\cite{New_Backfill}.
%~ Backfilling is, most often, based on the First Come - First Served principle as well.
%~ While the scheduler is running, jobs in the queue are sorted by priority and queuing time~\cite{New_Backfill}.
%~ Then, the backfilling will start immediately all jobs that can be started and completed without delaying the planned schedule.
%~ This algorithm allows to increase the density of supercomputer ressources' use by 20\% as well as reducing the average waiting time
%~ for execution~\cite{Maui_Scheduler}.
%~ There are two types of backfills. Conservative and EASY. Conservative backfill jobs that do not delay all other jobs. EASY backfill jobs that do not delay only the first scheduled job.

\paragraph{Improving the schedulers of Slurm and other batch systems}

To deal with communication-intensive jobs within Slurm, a solution can be to
minimize network contention by allocating nodes to even out node and switch contention
~\cite{minimize_network_contention}. 
In our model we are not studying the network topology and consider independant nodes.
This is reasonable, since our main concern is the cross-section bandwidth to a shared storage solution.
\todo[inline]{Carl: Motivating why switch topology of less relevance.}
Moreover, this requires a tree-based network topologies, which is different from our modem.
Furthermore, we are scheduling further down the topology (i.e nodes and not switches).
\todo[inline]{Carl: I find the two last two sentences a bit confusing. What are we really trying to say here?}

Batch-Aware Distributed File System~\cite{Explicit_Control_in_a_Batch-Aware_Distributed_File_System},
is a system designed to orchestrate large, I/O-intensive batch workloads on remote computing clusters.
It adds storage servers that export access to the disk.
They use detailed knowledge of workload characteristics.
However, the main idea is not data reuse, but to
facilitate the execution of I/O intensive batch
jobs by selecting appropriate storage policies
in regards to I/O scoping (creating a custom environment for each job
for data that will be used a lot by the job, thus not accessing the main disk too
much) and space allocation.


\subsection{Other papers about memory-aware scheduling}
Memory-aware scheduling on clusters have been studied in the past.
 
%~ "Algorithmic Modifications to the
%~ Jacobi-Davidson Parallel Eigensolver to Dynamically Balance External CPU and Memory Load"~\cite{loadbalance_and_trashing} tackle both load balancing and memory constraint. For the load balancing, they 
%~ estimate the time needed by the fastest processor to perform the required $m$ jobs. Thus they can equilibrate the load
%~ with this information. In our study we could use a similar strategy by estimating the 
%~ processing time of a job, the length of a file transfer, and the amount of file transfers needed.
%~ To deal with memory constraint the strategy applied in the paper is to check if 
%~ nodes are thrashing data. If yes, it will recede execution of jobs on this node.
%~ The main differences are that they are using dynamic jobs. Also, we would like to 
%~ manage eviction and optimize data reuse during the scheduling phase, instead of
%~ receding execution on nodes.

Some researchers~\cite{Nikolopoulos2003AdaptiveSU}
are focusing on a better utilization of idling memory together with 
thrashing limitation. Our focus will be to control data loads and eviction so the
processing order will naturally limits thrashing.

\subsection{HDFS, a popular distributed file system - Draft, I need to double check my sources}
HDFS~\cite{hdfs} or Hadoop Distributed File System is a distributed file system that
incorporate storage-aware scheduling. HDFS is particularly used for applications that have large data sets. 
%~ "Moving Computation is Cheaper than Moving Data" is an important idea for HDFS.
It migrates a computation closer to where the data is located rather than moving the data to where
the application is running.
%~ Here are our main differences with HDFS. Firstly, HDFS is made for commodity hardware, prone
%~ to more errors and breakdown, so to minimize the risk of failure, data are redundant on the nodes.
HDFS is made for commodity(?) hardware, where errors need to be minimized. Thus, data are redundant
to avoid breakdowns.
In our use case, the scheduler will run on professional clusters and the main point is to load as 
little data as possible. 
Secondly, HDFS is mainly a storage system, with an historic on files locations. \todo[inline]{Carl: I find this second point far more important. HDFS is treating the storage point as the actual source of the data, while anything loaded on the notes in our scenario is just ephemeral copies of a shared storage, which itself has significant levels of redundance. Individual nodes can sometimes fail in an HPC cluster as well, but those result in the loss of a job, not of primary storage.}
It is not relevant in our use case. 
Thirdly, the scheduling can have issues. A paper describe in detail some problems from MapReduce~\cite{issue_with_hdfs}, the
programming language used in HFDS: the static configuration of the memory allocation, the one-task assigned buffers, the
lake of concurrent task running strategy and the I/O negative impact in memory during the shuffling phase.
To resolve these issues, Mammoth~\cite{Mammoth} was created. It optimize memory usage on a node depending on the hardware configuration.
Our approach is different because we are not dealing with MapReduce or memory allocation.
Our approach is upstream. We can only allocate jobs to nodes. Moreover, we would like to maintain
%~ equity among users  while optimizing I/O.
In addition, HDFS is particularly efficient when the input data used are identical over time.
In our case, one user will submit a lot of different jobs using the same data, but between users,
the inputs are not the same. So HDFS would be less efficient.

\section{Framework - Draft}\label{sec.framework}

We consider the problem of scheduling a set of independent jobs,
denoted $\jobset = {J_1, J_2, ..., J_k}$ on a set of independent nodes:
$\nodeset = {\Node{1}, \Node{2}, ..., \Node{l}}$.
These nodes are equipped with $m$ cores noted: $\Node{1}(c_1, c_2, ..., c_m)$.
the memory of a node is set to $M\,GB$.

Each job is using an input file noted $\file(J_i)$ and
stored in the main shared file system.
During the processing of a job $J_i$ on $\Node{k}$,
$\file(J_i)$ must be in the memory of $\Node{k}$. 
We denote by $\fileset = F_1, F_2, ..., F_n$ the set of input files.
Each file has a size in GB noted $\memory(F_i)$.
The size of a file is proportional to the number of cores requested by the job using the file.
This size is thus a multiple of $\frac{M}{m}$.

Each job is equipped with the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Resource requirement: $\core(J_i)$ such that $1 \leq \core(J_i) \leq m$.
	\item An input file $\file(J_i) \in \fileset$.
	\item A submission date $\submissiontime(J_i)$.
	\item A requested running time (or walltime) noted $\walltime(J_i)$ and corresponding to
	the maximum time during which $J_i$ can run on a node.
	\item An actual running time named $\duration(J_i)$. This attribute is not known by
	the scheduler. If $\duration(J_i) \l \walltime(J_i)$, then the job will terminate at
	time $\start(J_i) + \duration(J_i)$. 
	Else the job will be terminated at time $\start(J_i) + \walltime(J_i)$.
\end{itemize}

We do not consider the data output of jobs.
Each of the $m$ jobs must be processed on some of the $K$ nodes. 
We consider that all jobs are single nodes.

The file sharing system initially contains all of $\fileset$.
Each node is connected to the file sharing system with a limited bandwidth.
Each node has the same bandwidth noted $\bandwidth$.
The bounded bandwidth as well as the sizes of the files are the reasons why
we aim at restricting the amount of data movement.

The memory of a node is used only by physical writing of files and denoted by $\memory(\Node{i})$.
A file can be shared by two jobs $J_i$ and $J_j$ only in the following situations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $J_i$ and $J_j$ are computed in parallel on the same node.
	\item $J_i$ and $J_j$ are computed on the same node consecutively.
\end{enumerate}
Otherwise we consider that memory operations will cause the files to be evicted.

We now define more formally the allocation of the jobs to the node and
their schedule.
We denote by $\storage(\Node{k}, t)$, the set of files loaded on $\Node{k}$
at time $t$. 
We denote by $\sigma(\Node{k}, \mathit{nb}_k)$ the set of $\mathit{nb}_k$ jobs
scheduled on $\Node{k}$, each equipped with a $\start(J_i)$ and an
input file $\file(J_i)$.
$\sigma(\Node{k}, i)$ corresponds to the $i^\text{th}$ job on this schedule.
On $\Node{k}$, the schedule is made of a
succession of $\mathit{nb}_k$
steps, each step being composed of the
following stages (in this order):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $\start(\sigma(\Node{k}, i)) = t$ do:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If the input file $\file(\sigma(\Node{k}, i))$ is not yet in memory, it is 
		loaded in the memory of $\Node{k}$ with a duration of $\frac{\memory(\file(\sigma(\Node{k}, i)))}{\bandwidth}$.
		\item Job $\sigma(\Node{k}, i)$ is processed on $\Node{k}$ during at most $\walltime(J_i)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
It is important to note that the file transfers are done before the computation and can not be overlapped.

We are in a non-preemptive case, meaning that a job cannot be stopped and resumed.

\todo[inline]{Max: Say that we are online.}
\todo[inline]{Max: Say that in our case the backfilling is only inside a node and between multiple nodes?}
\todo[inline]{Max: Say that the schedule is re-done each time a core is liberated?}

\section{Schedulers - Draft}\label{sec.schedulers}

In this section, we present the various schedulers used to solve
the partitioning problem presented above. 

Some of these methods uses start or completion time as a way to
schedule each job (section~\ref{subsec.fcfs_eft}) while another compute 
a score to choose the best node (section~\ref{subsec.score}) and others
are opting for a mixed strategy between locality and earliest possible start time
(sections~\ref{subsec.mixed} and~\ref{subsec.opportunistic}).

\subsection{Our two baseline\todo[inline]{Max: Is there a "s" at baseline at plural?} schedulers: FCFS and EFT}\label{subsec.fcfs_eft}

A widely used and considered effective job's scheduler is 
First-Come-First-Serve or FCFS.
It's associated with a backfilling strategy known to increase
a supercomputer ressources' use~\cite{maui}. 
The most commonly used backfilling strategy, called conservative 
backfilling~\cite{Characterization_of_Backfilling}~\cite{slurm_website_scheduling}~\cite{Introducing-New-Backfill-based} follows
a simple paradigm: "a job can only be backfilled if it does not
delay a job of higher prioriy".
\todo[inline]{Max: I've putted citation for conservative backfilling in this section 
but maybe it should go in the related works ?}
The FCFS strategy coupled with conservative backfilling is implemented as follows:
\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
	\caption{First-Come-First-Serve with conservative backfilling (FCFS-BF)}\label{algo.fcfsbf}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State Job $J_i$ needs to be scheduled. Current time is $current\_time$.
		\State Find $\Node{k}$, such that, $t_k$, the time at which $\core(J_i)$ cores are available on $\Node{k}$ is minimal
		\If{$t_k = current\_time$}
			\State Return $J_i$ scheduled on $\Node{k}$ at time $current\_time$
		\Else
			\ForEach{$\Node{l} \in \nodeset$}
				\State Find $shadow_l$, the time at which less than $\core(J_i)$ cores will be available
				\If{$current\_time + \walltime(J_i) \leq shadow_l$}
					\State Return $J_i$ scheduled on $\Node{l}$ at time $current\_time$
				\EndIf
			\EndFor
			\State Return $J_i$ scheduled on $\Node{k}$ at time $t_k$
		\EndIf
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\end{axis}\end{tikzpicture}

Under our model, a fair baseline would be a scheduler capable
of reducing file transfers while keeping the First-Come-First-Serve
principle. This scheduler is Earliest-Finish-Time (or EFT).
It's an enhanced version of FCFS which chooses to schedule a job
on the node with the earliest available finish time, thus considering
the time to load the file, and consequently choosing nodes where a file will
be re-used. 
\todo[inline]{Max: Say that EFT with bf consider completion time as well.}

			%~ \EndFor
			%~ \State Return $J_i$ scheduled on $\Node{k}$ at time $t_k$
		%~ \EndIf
	%~ \end{algorithmic}
%~ \end{algorithm}


Coupled with it, we add the conservative backfilling strategy mentioned earlier:

\subsection{A locality-focused algorithm: SCORE\todo{Max: Or another name}}

The previous strategies are focusing on starting as soon as possible (FCFS)
of finishing as soon as possible a job (EFT).
Those are good methods to avoid starvation of a node and reduce queue times.
However, they are ignoring the effect multiplying the number of copy of a file
over multiple nodes. Indeed, selecting different nodes for jobs using a common
file will increase file loads in order to minimize immediate queue times.
Our strategy (called SCORE) aims at favoring locality in order to reduce
queue times in the long run by reusing the same files. 

The main principle of our algorithm detailed in Algorithm~\ref{algo.score} 
is to find a balance between the earliest available time and data locality,
with a tiebreak on data eviction. A score composed of the earliest available 
time, the time to load or wait for the files to be available and the cost of 
reloading evicted files is computed for each node. The job is then scheduled
on the node with the lowest score.

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]\caption{SCORE (Draft)}\label{algo.score}\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\section{Working with a real workload and cluster\todo[inline]{Max: Another name for this section?}}\label{sec.working}
Actual workloads at HPC resources shared by a great number of users with diverse needs can contain structures
that are non-trivial to replicate in a fully artificial simulated job pattern. We believe that this is especially
true for data-dependent patterns, where a project might launch a burst of jobs using the same file just a few thousand
core hours in length, then be quiet for a long time processing the results, and then launch another such burst.

On the other hand, it would be disruptive to expose a real user community to a wide variety of experimental scheduling strategies.

For this reason, we used logs of historical submitted jobs, in terms of their exact submission time, size, stated runtime, and actual runtime.
Since explicit data dependencies are not encoded in SLURM job specifications, we created an artificial pattern for this. 
\todo[inline]{Carl: Max, please elaborate. Max: Okay I added a paragraph.}
We first consider that each job is carrying an input file.
Let's consider two jobs from the logs of historical submitted jobs: $J_i$ and $J_j$.
They will be attributed a common input file if they match all the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\core(J_i) = \core(J_j)$ i.e they are requiring the same amount of cores.
	\item $J_i$ and $J_j$ were submitted by the same user.
	\item $J_i$ and $J_j$ were submitted in a 800 seconds timeframe.
\end{enumerate}
Otherwise we consider that $J_i$ and $J_j$ are using distinct input files.

\todo[inline]{Elisabeth: I think we should say Rackham so that readers can checkout the hardware, but perhaps it should be fully blind as a starting point.}
The resource consists of 486 nodes with 20 cores each, with most of them having 128GB of RAM, with some 256GB and 512GB nodes. \todo[inline]{Max: I thought it was 1024 GB nodes for the biggest size?}

\todo[inline]{Max: I added a paragraph on why all nodes are the same size in our case:}
Having $L$ different nodes sizes raises a new constraint. The model would have
$L$ subsets of nodes, each possibly containing a different number of nodes.
An input file can be too large to be computed on one or multiple of those subsets.
Thus, in addition to the scheduling problem, a load balancing problem arises.
Indeed, the scheduler need to be able to manage each subset of nodes as an independant 
resource that need to avoid starvation while also not being saturated in case of a large
batch of jobs that could be submitted at once and that could only be computed on this node's size.
Consequently, to focus on the issue of data-locality, we use a set of 486 nodes of size 
128 GB and the size of an input file is a multiple of 6.4.
In other words, for each $\file(i) \in \fileset$, $\memory(\file(i)) = 6.4 \times n$ with 
$1 \leq n \leq 20$.

The utilization levels are typically high ($>90\%$), but
not fully consistently so. The vast majority of jobs on this resources are single node jobs, even sometimes single core jobs. Run times
could extent to up to 10 days, while some jobs only last a few minutes. We do not claim that this is an ideal job submission strategy,
but rather it is an empirical observation of an actual user community including, but not exclusively consisting of, many subfields of the life sciences with highly data-dependent workflows.
