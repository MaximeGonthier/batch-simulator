\title{Locality-aware batch scheduling of I/O intensive workloads}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
  Clusters make use of workload schedulers such as
  the Slurm Workload Manager to allocate computing jobs onto
  nodes. These schedulers usually aim at a good trade-off between
  increasing resource utilization and user satisfaction (decreasing
  job waiting time). However, these schedulers are typically unaware
  of jobs sharing large input files, which may happen in data
  intensive scenarios. The same input files may be loaded several
  times, leading to a waste of resources.
   
  We study how to design a \textit{data-aware job scheduler} that is
  able to keep large input files on the computing nodes, without
  impacting other memory needs, and can use previously loaded files to
  \textit{limit data transfers in order to reduce the waiting times of
    jobs}.

  We present three schedulers capable of distributing the load between
  the computing nodes as well as re-using an input file already loaded
  in the memory of some node as much as possible.
  
  We perform simulations using real cluster usage traces to compare
  them to classical job schedulers.  The results show that
  keeping data in local memory between successive jobs and using data
  locality information to schedule jobs allows a reduction in job
  waiting time and a drastic decrease in the amount of data transfers.

\section{Related Work - Draft}\label{sec.related_work}

\subsection{Scheduling jobs on large clusters}

To schedule jobs on batch systems, two systems are prominent: the Slurm Workload Manager~\cite{SLURM} and OAR~\cite{oar}.
Slurm is used on most HPC clusters. Its default strategy is to schedule jobs baed on priorities derived
from submission time, in other words a First-Come First-Serve strategy
(or FCFS)\footnote{{\scriptsize\url{https://slurm.schedmd.com/sched_config.html}}}.

On top of that, a backfilling algorithm is often used~\cite{New_Backfill}.
%~ Backfilling is, most often, based on the First Come - First Served principle as well.
%~ While the scheduler is running, jobs in the queue are sorted by priority and queuing time~\cite{New_Backfill}.
%~ Then, the backfilling will start immediately all jobs that can be started and completed without delaying the planned schedule.
%~ This algorithm allows to increase the density of supercomputer ressources' use by 20\% as well as reducing the average waiting time
%~ for execution~\cite{Maui_Scheduler}.
%~ There are two types of backfills. Conservative and EASY. Conservative backfill jobs that do not delay all other jobs. EASY backfill jobs that do not delay only the first scheduled job.

\subsection{Improving the schedulers of Slurm and other batch systems}

To deal with communication-intensive jobs within Slurm, a solution can be to
minimize network contention by allocating nodes to even out node and switch contention
~\cite{minimize_network_contention}. 
In our model we are not studying the network topology and consider independant nodes.
This is reasonable, since our main concern is the cross-section bandwidth to a shared storage solution.
\todo[inline]{Carl: Motivating why switch topology of less relevance.}
%~ Moreover, this requires a tree-based network topologies, which is different from our model.
%~ Furthermore, we are scheduling further down the topology (i.e nodes and not switches).
\todo[inline]{Carl: I find the two last two sentences a bit confusing. What are we really trying to say here?
Max: I was trying to say that they use the network topology to make a decision and we don't. 
It was just another way to phrase what you wrote so I removed it. Also, their strategy 
is developed for a tree-based network topology, so it might not work on other topology like a ring or a star?
So, we might want to say that our approach is more generic in regards to the network topology?}

Batch-Aware Distributed File System~\cite{Explicit_Control_in_a_Batch-Aware_Distributed_File_System},
is a system designed to orchestrate large, I/O-intensive batch workloads on remote computing clusters.
It adds storage servers that export access to the disk.
They use detailed knowledge of workload characteristics.
However, the main idea is not data reuse, but to
facilitate the execution of I/O intensive batch
jobs by selecting appropriate storage policies
in regards to I/O scoping (creating a custom environment for each job
for data that will be used a lot by the job, thus not accessing the main disk too
much) and space allocation.


\subsection{Other papers about memory-aware scheduling}
Memory-aware scheduling on clusters have been studied in the past.
 
%~ "Algorithmic Modifications to the
%~ Jacobi-Davidson Parallel Eigensolver to Dynamically Balance External CPU and Memory Load"~\cite{loadbalance_and_trashing} tackle both load balancing and memory constraint. For the load balancing, they 
%~ estimate the time needed by the fastest processor to perform the required $m$ jobs. Thus they can equilibrate the load
%~ with this information. In our study we could use a similar strategy by estimating the 
%~ processing time of a job, the length of a file transfer, and the amount of file transfers needed.
%~ To deal with memory constraint the strategy applied in the paper is to check if 
%~ nodes are thrashing data. If yes, it will recede execution of jobs on this node.
%~ The main differences are that they are using dynamic jobs. Also, we would like to 
%~ manage eviction and optimize data reuse during the scheduling phase, instead of
%~ receding execution on nodes.

Some researchers~\cite{Nikolopoulos2003AdaptiveSU}
are focusing on a better utilization of idling memory together with 
thrashing limitation. Our focus will be to control data loads and eviction so the
processing order will naturally limits thrashing.

\subsection{HDFS, a popular distributed file system}
HDFS~\cite{hdfs} or Hadoop Distributed File System is a distributed file system that
incorporate storage-aware scheduling. It is particularly used to store large
volume of data on a large number of systems. It's abstraction facilitates access to data
under such conditions. Moreover, HDFS migrates a computation closer to where the data is
located rather than moving the data to where the application is running in order to reduce communications.

HDFS is mainly a storage system, thus it uses an historic on files locations to serve as a backup. 
\todo[inline]{Carl: I find this second point far more important. HDFS is treating the storage point as the actual source of the data, while anything loaded on the nodes in our scenario is just ephemeral copies of a shared storage, which itself has significant levels of redundancy. Individual nodes can sometimes fail in an HPC cluster as well, but those result in the loss of a job, not of primary storage. Max: Ok, I re-wrote this section accordingly.}
In our scenario, we copy the data from an already redundant system (an online database for example) and store it locally on the node in an ephemeral way. Thus, in the event of a crash, we do not manage the data which is already redundant, it simply results in an aborted job.

Secondly, the scheduling can cause issues. A paper describe in detail some problems from
MapReduce~\cite{issue_with_hdfs}, the programming model used in HDFS.
%~ it ignores the heterogeneous consumption of resource of the different
%~ phases the task go through.
%~ To resolve these issues, Mammoth~\cite{Mammoth} was created. 
%~ It optimize memory usage on a node depending on the hardware configuration.
%~ Our approach is different because we are not dealing with MapReduce or memory allocation.
By not using a distributed file system, we avoid altogether these problems. 
In addition, HDFS is particularly efficient when the input data used are identical over time.
In our case, one user will submit a lot of different jobs using the same data, but between users,
the inputs are not the same. So HDFS would be less efficient.

\section{Framework - Draft}\label{sec.framework}

We consider the problem of scheduling a set of $N$ independent jobs,
denoted $\jobset = {J_1, J_2, \ldots, J_N}$ on a set of $P$ nodes:
$\nodeset = \{\Node{1}, \Node{2}, \ldots, \Node{P}\}$.
%% LM: to be merged later:
Each node $N_i$ is equipped with $m$ cores noted:
$c^i_1,\ldots,c^i_m$ sharing a memory of size $M$.

Each job depends on an input file noted $\file(J_i)$, which is
initially stored in the main shared file system.  During the
processing of a job $J_i$ on $\Node{k}$, file $\file(J_i)$ must be in
the memory of $\Node{k}$. If this is not the case before starting
computation of job $J_i$, then file $\file(J_i)$ is loaded into the
memory.  We denote by $\fileset = \{F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n\}$ the set
of discting input files, whose size is denoted by $\size(F_i)$. Each
job runs on a single node, but on different number of cores.



Each job $J_i$ has the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Resource requirement: job $J_i$ requests $\core(J_i)$  cores, such that $1 \leq \core(J_i) \leq m$;
\item Input file: $\file(J_i) \in \fileset$;
\item Submission date: $\submissiontime(J_i)$.
\item Requested running time (or walltime): $\walltime(J_i)$: if not
  finished after this duration, job $J_i$ is killed by the scheduler;
\item Actual running time: $\duration(J_i)$ (unknown to  the scheduler).
\end{itemize}

We do not consider the data output of jobs.

Each of the $N$ jobs must be processed on some of the $P$ nodes.  As
stated earlier, the shared file system initially contains all of files
of $\fileset$.  Each node is connected to the file system with a link
of limited bandwidth, denoted by $\bandwidth$.  The limited bandwidth
as well as the large sizes of the files are the reasons why we aim at
restricting the amount of data movement.

We consider that the memory of a node, denoted by $\memory(\Node{i})$,
is only used by the jobs' input files, since all other data are
negligible in front of the input files.
A file stored in the memory of a node can be shared by two jobs $J_i$ and $J_j$ only in the following situations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $J_i$ and $J_j$ are computed in parallel on the same node.
	\item $J_i$ and $J_j$ are computed on the same node consecutively.
\end{enumerate}
Otherwise we consider that memory operations of jobs scheduled between
$J_i$ and $J_j$ will cause the file to be evicted.

We now define more formally the allocation of the jobs to the node and
their schedule.
We denote by $\storage(\Node{k}, t)$, the set of files loaded on $\Node{k}$
at time $t$. The constraint on the limited size of the memory can be
summarized by:
$$
\forall k,\forall t \quad \sum_{F_i\in \storage(\Node{k},t)} \size(F_i)\leq M.
$$

For each $J_i$, we denote by
$\allocatedcores(J_i)$ the set of cores of the same node
$\allocatednode(J_i)$ allocated to $J_i$ and by
$\start(J_i)$ is starting time. If at this time, the input file of
$J_i$ is already in the memory of $\allocatednode(J_i)$, then $J_i$
can start its execution at time $\start(J_i)$. Otherwise, its input
file is first loaded, and the execution starts at time 
$\start+\size(\file(J_i))/\bandwidth$.

\todo[inline]{LM: maybe we should add/formalize:\\
  - computation of the execution starting time and completion time,\\
  - constraints on the fact that a core cannot process two jobs simultaneously.}

% We denote by $\sigma(\Node{k}, \mathit{nb}_k)$ the set of $\mathit{nb}_k$ jobs
% scheduled on $\Node{k}$, each equipped with a $\start(J_i)$ and an
% input file $\file(J_i)$.
% $\sigma(\Node{k}, i)$ corresponds to the $i^\text{th}$ job on this schedule.
% On $\Node{k}$, the schedule is made of a
% succession of $\mathit{nb}_k$
% steps, each step being composed of the
% following stages (in this order):
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item If $\start(\sigma(\Node{k}, i)) = t$ do:
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item If the input file $\file(\sigma(\Node{k}, i))$ is not yet in memory, it is 
% 		loaded in the memory of $\Node{k}$ with a duration of $\frac{\size(\file(\sigma(\Node{k}, i)))}{\bandwidth}$.
% 		\item Job $\sigma(\Node{k}, i)$ is processed on $\Node{k}$ during at most $\walltime(J_i)$.
% 	\end{enumerate}
% \end{enumerate}
It is important to note that the file transfer is done before the computation and cannot be overlapped.
Jobs are non-preemptible: when started, a job is executed through its completion.


\section{Schedulers - Draft}\label{sec.schedulers}
\todo[inline]{Max: Say that we are online, we have no way to know the number or length of future jobs.}
\todo[inline]{Max: Say that in our case the backfilling is only inside a node and not between multiple nodes.}
\todo[inline]{Max: Say that the schedule is re-done each time a core is liberated?}

In this section, we present the various schedulers used to solve
the partitioning problem presented above. 

Some of these methods uses start or completion time as a way to
schedule each job (section~\ref{subsec.fcfs_eft}) while another compute 
a score to choose the best node (section~\ref{subsec.score}) and others
are opting for a mixed strategy between locality and earliest possible start time
(sections~\ref{subsec.mixed} and~\ref{subsec.opportunistic}).

\subsection{Our two baseline\todo[inline]{Max: Is there a "s" at baseline at plural?} schedulers: FCFS and EFT}\label{subsec.fcfs_eft}

A widely used and considered effective job's scheduler is 
First-Come-First-Serve or FCFS.
It's associated with a backfilling strategy known to increase
a supercomputer ressources' use~\cite{maui}. 
The most commonly used backfilling strategy, called conservative 
backfilling~\cite{Characterization_of_Backfilling}~\cite{slurm_website_scheduling}~\cite{Introducing-New-Backfill-based} follows
a simple paradigm: "a job can only be backfilled if it does not
delay a job of higher prioriy".
\todo[inline]{Max: I've putted citation for conservative backfilling in this section 
but maybe it should go in the related works ?}

\todo[inline]{Parler des cores dans le framework}

The FCFS strategy coupled with conservative backfilling is implemented as follows:	
\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{First-Come-First-Serve with conservative backfilling (FCFS-BF)}\label{algo.fcfsbf}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\ForEach{$J_i \in$ the job's queue} \Comment{The job's queue is sorted by submission times}
		\ForEach{$\Node{k} \in \nodeset$}
			\State Find smallest time $t_k$ such that $\core(J_i)$ cores are available until at least time $t_k + \walltime(J_i)$ on cores $c_1, ..., c_{\core(J_i)}$ of $\Node{k}$
		\EndFor
		\State Schedule $J_i$ on the node with the smallest $t_k$
		\State Cores $c_1, ..., c_{\core(J_i)}$ of $\Node{k}$ are updated to be available at time $t_k + \walltime(J_i)$
		\State Cores $c_1, ..., c_m$ of $\Node{k}$ are sorted in increasing order of available time \Comment{With a sorted list of cores, writing line 3 is easier}
	\EndFor
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\addplot[fill=gray] coordinates {(4,0) (4,2) (6,2) (6,0)} node at (current path bounding box.center) {T3};  
\end{axis}\end{tikzpicture}

Under our model, a fair baseline would be a scheduler capable
of reducing file transfers while keeping the First-Come-First-Serve
principle. This scheduler is Earliest-Finish-Time (or EFT).
It's an enhanced version of FCFS which chooses to schedule a job
on the node with the earliest available finish time, thus considering
the time to load the file, and consequently choosing nodes where a file will
be re-used. 
\todo[inline]{Max: Say that EFT with bf consider completion time as well.}

	\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{A locality-focused algorithm: SCORE\todo{Max: Or another name}}

The previous strategies are focusing on starting as soon as possible (FCFS)
of finishing as soon as possible a job (EFT).
Those are good methods to avoid starvation of a node and reduce queue times.
However, they are ignoring the effect multiplying the number of copy of a file
over multiple nodes. Indeed, selecting different nodes for jobs using a common
file will increase file loads in order to minimize immediate queue times.
Our strategy (called SCORE) aims at favoring locality in order to reduce
queue times in the long run by reusing the same files. 

The main principle of our algorithm detailed in Algorithm~\ref{algo.score} 
is to find a balance between the earliest available time and data locality,
with a tiebreak on data eviction. A score composed of the earliest available 
time, the time to load or wait for the files to be available and the cost of 
reloading evicted files is computed for each node. The job is then scheduled
on the node with the lowest score.

\section{Working with information from a real workload and cluster\todo[inline]{Max: Another name for this section?}}\label{sec.working}
Actual workloads at HPC resources shared by a great number of users with diverse needs can contain structures
that are non-trivial to replicate in a fully artificial simulated job pattern. We believe that this is especially
true for data-dependent patterns, where a project might launch a burst of jobs using the same file just a few thousand
core hours in length, then be quiet for a long time processing the results, and then launch another such burst.

On the other hand, it would be disruptive to expose a real user community to a wide variety of experimental scheduling strategies.

For this reason, we used logs of historical submitted jobs, in terms of their exact submission time, size, stated runtime, and actual runtime.
Since explicit data dependencies are not encoded in SLURM job specifications, we created an artificial pattern for this. 
\todo[inline]{Carl: Max, please elaborate. Max: Okay, I added a paragraph.}
Each job is carrying an input file.
Let's consider two jobs from the logs of historical submitted jobs: $J_i$ and $J_j$.
They will be attributed a common input file if they match all the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\core(J_i) = \core(J_j)$ i.e they are requiring the same amount of cores.
	\item $J_i$ and $J_j$ were submitted by the same user.
	\item $J_i$ and $J_j$ were submitted in a 800 seconds timeframe.
\end{enumerate}
Otherwise we consider that $J_i$ and $J_j$ are using distinct input files.

\todo[inline]{Elisabeth: I think we should say Rackham so that readers can checkout the hardware, but perhaps it should be fully blind as a starting point.}
The resource consists of 486 nodes with 20 cores each, with most of them having 128GB of RAM, with some 256GB and 512GB nodes. \todo[inline]{Max: I thought it was 1024 GB nodes for the biggest size?}

\todo[inline]{Max: I added a paragraph on why all nodes are the same size in our case:}
Having $L$ different nodes sizes raises a new constraint. The model would have
$L$ subsets of nodes, each possibly containing a different number of nodes.
An input file can be too large to be computed on one or multiple of those subsets.
Thus, in addition to the scheduling problem, a load balancing problem arises.
Indeed, the scheduler need to be able to manage each subset of nodes as an independant 
resource that need to avoid starvation while also not being saturated in case of a large
batch of jobs that could be submitted at once and that could only be computed on this node's size.
Consequently, to focus on the issue of data-locality, we use a set of 486 nodes of size 
128 GB and the size of an input file is a multiple of 6.4.
In other words, for each $\file(i) \in \fileset$, $\size(\file(i)) = 6.4 \times n$ with 
$1 \leq n \leq 20$.

The utilization levels are typically high ($>90\%$), but
not fully consistently so. The vast majority of jobs on this resources are single node jobs, even sometimes single core jobs. Run times
could extent to up to 10 days, while some jobs only last a few minutes. We do not claim that this is an ideal job submission strategy,
but rather it is an empirical observation of an actual user community including, but not exclusively consisting of, many subfields of the life sciences with highly data-dependent workflows.

\section{Performance evaluation and analysis}\label{sec.evaluations}

We present below the results of experimental evaluations conducted 
on X\todo[inline]{Max: To update once all experiments are complete} days
from a real workload history.

\subsection{Settings\todo[inline]{Maybe this section should be merged with the one above?}}

\todo[inline]{put this somewhere/explain:
We consider that these jobs are dedicated to processing their input
file. Hence, the larger the input file, the more cores the job
requests, such that the file occupies a fraction of the memory
proportional to the number of cores allocated to the job. A job with
$k$ cores will be devoted a memory of size $k M/m$. Thus, we consider
that file sizes are multiple of $M/m$.  }

All strategies as well as the two baselines have been implemented on
a simulator that we developed. Each application scenario is a day on the log's history of
the workload.
The way we collect jobs from the log's history is represented in Figure~\ref{fig.workload}.

On the real cluster, when a job finishes, it's information
are written in a file corresponding to the day at which the day finished.
This information contains the node that was attributed, the real job's duration, the walltime, 
the number of cores required, the user that submitted the job, the submission time, 
the start and end time.
Our goal is to schedule and evaluate all the jobs submitted on 
\textit{Day 1} in the settings in which they were on the real cluster.
In order to get all the jobs that were submitted on \textit{Day 1}, we need to
look into the logs of days 1 to 10. Indeed, most jobs do not last for more than 10 days,
thus we should cover the vast majority of jobs that were actually submitted on 
\textit{Day 1}. 
Jobs of \textit{Day 1} respectively preceded and succeeded with jobs from \textit{Day 0}
and \textit{Day 2} in order to place \textit{Day 1} in its "real environment",
i.e. in the situation in which it was on the real cluster, with jobs submitted
before and after.
Jobs from \textit{Day -1} are jobs that were submitted before \textit{Day 0} and that are still running at the beggining of \textit{Day 0}.
We use the information from the log's history to start this jobs on the nodes
were they really were scheduled at the times at which they were started.
This allows us to exactly replicate the state of the cluster on this day before starting
to schedule jobs from \textit{Day 0}.
To summarize, before \textit{Day 0}, jobs are placed on the cluster
following the log's history. Starting from \textit{Day 0} we 
use one of our scheduler and only evaluate jobs submitted on \textit{Day 1}
to avoid any side effect.

We measure the obtained performance with the mean
stretch from jobs of \textit{Day 1}.
The stretch of a job is the flow of the job divided
by the flow the job would have gotten if it was scheduled on an empty cluster.
They are denoted respectively $Flow(J_i)$ and $Empty\_flow(J_i)$:

$$
Flow(J_i) = end\_time(J_i) - \submissiontime(J_i)
$$
$$
Flow(J_i) = (\start(J_i) + min(\duration(J_i) + t_k' - t_k, \walltime(J_i)) - \submissiontime(J_i))
$$
$$
	Empty\_flow(J_i) = min(\duration(J_i) + \frac{\memory(\file(J_i))}{\bandwidth}, \walltime(J_i))
$$
The stretch of one job is computed as follows:
$$
	Stretch_{J_i} = \frac{Flow(J_i)}{Empty\_flow(J_i)}
$$
\todo[inline]{Max: Is it okay here to use the $t_k' - t_k$ notation used in the pseudocodes to get the duration of the load that was required?}
We also evaluate the total amount of time spent waiting for a file to be available.

\subsection{Results on an under-used cluster}

Figure~\ref{07_16_cluster_usage} shows us a visual representation of 
our cluster's usage over time. The solid black dotted line is the total
number of cores available.
\todo[inline]{Max: Change the label once we know which one is the first shown figure of this type}
The solid blue line shows the number of cores occupied by running jobs.
The dashed blue line shows the additional number of cores that would be needed
to run all the jobs in the queue at a given time (this would thus be the number
of used cores if all the jobs where running in parallel).
The red lines show the jobs in both categories that have their submission
time within our evaluation window, in other words they are sub-parts of the blue line
that we evaluate.
