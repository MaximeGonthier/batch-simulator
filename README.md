# batch simulator for energy incentive

This repo is a copy of the repository https://gitlab.inria.fr/mgonthie/data-aware-batch-scheduling made on the 8 Feb 2024.
It does not contain all of the things related to the project conducted in Uppsala.

This simulator aims at improving the one from https://gitlab.inria.fr/mgonthie/data-aware-batch-scheduling to include functionalitites like heterogeneous set of nodes, energy consumption of a job on a node, scheduling to incentivize users to be more energy efficient and simulate the behavior of users with set goals (speed, energy, mix of both).
